# Food-Delivery
Introducing "Tomato," a full-stack food delivery website developed by our team using the MERN stackâ€”MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. This project offers a seamless user experience with features such as user authentication, a dynamic frontend supporting responsive design, and a robust backend integrated with MongoDB. Additionally, it includes a secure payment system powered by Stripe and an intuitive admin panel, also offering theme versatility.

Our team, comprising dedicated software developers, embarked on this project to deepen our understanding of full-stack development and to create a functional, user-friendly application that addresses real-world needs. We meticulously designed "Tomato" to ensure a responsive and engaging user interface, coupled with a secure and efficient backend infrastructure.
